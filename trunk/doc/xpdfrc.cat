NAME
       xpdfrc - configuration file for Xpdf tools (version 3.01)

DESCRIPTION
       All  of  the  Xpdf tools read a single configuration file.
       If you have a .xpdfrc file in your home directory, it will
       be read.  Otherwise, a system-wide configuration file will
       be read from /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc, if it  exists.   (This
       is  its  default  location; depending on build options, it
       may be placed elsewhere.)  On Win32  systems,  the  xpdfrc
       file  should  be  placed in the same directory as the exe-
       cutables.

       The xpdfrc file consists  of  a  series  of  configuration
       options,  one  per  line.   Blank lines and lines starting
       with a '#' (comments) are ignored.

       The following  sections  list  all  of  the  configuration
       options, sorted into functional groups.  There is an exam-
       ples section at the end.

INCLUDE FILES
       include config-file
              Includes the specified config file.  The effect  of
              this  is  equivalent  to  inserting the contents of
              config-file directly into the parent config file in
              place  of the include command.  Config files can be
              nested arbitrarily deeply.

CHARACTER MAPPING
       nameToUnicode map-file
              Specifies a file with the  mapping  from  character
              names to Unicode.  This is used to handle PDF fonts
              that have valid encodings but no  ToUnicode  entry.
              Each line of a nameToUnicode file looks like this:

                   hex-string name

              The  hex-string  is  the  Unicode (UCS-2) character
              index, and  name  is  the  corresponding  character
              name.  Multiple nameToUnicode files can be used; if
              a character name is given more than once, the  code
              in  the  last  specified  file is used.  There is a
              built-in default nameToUnicode table  with  all  of
              Adobe's standard character names.

       cidToUnicode registry-ordering map-file
              Specifies  the file with the mapping from character
              collection to Unicode.  Each line of a cidToUnicode
              file represents one character:

                   hex-string

              The  hex-string  is  the  Unicode (UCS-2) index for
              that character.  The first line  maps  CID  0,  the
              second line CID 1, etc.  File size is determined by
              size of the character collection.  Only one file is
              allowed  per  character collection; the last speci-
              fied file is used.  There are no built-in cidToUni-
              code mappings.

       unicodeToUnicode font-name-substring map-file
              This  is  used  to work around PDF fonts which have
              incorrect Unicode information.  It specifies a file
              which  maps  from  the  given  (incorrect)  Unicode
              indexes to the correct ones.  The mapping  will  be
              used    for    any   font   whose   name   contains
              font-name-substring.  Each line of a  unicodeToUni-
              code file represents one Unicode character:

                  in-hex out-hex1 out-hex2 ...

              The  in-hex  field  is an input (incorrect) Unicode
              index, and the rest of the fields are one  or  more
              output  (correct) Unicode indexes.  Each occurrence
              of in-hex will be converted to the specified output
              sequence.

       unicodeMap encoding-name map-file
              Specifies  the  file  with  mapping from Unicode to
              encoding-name.  These encodings are used for X dis-
              play  fonts and text output (see below).  Each line
              of a unicodeMap file represents a range of  one  or
              more  Unicode  characters  which maps linearly to a
              range in the output encoding:

                   in-start-hex in-end-hex out-start-hex

              Entries for single characters  can  be  abbreviated
              to:

                   in-hex out-hex

              The in-start-hex and in-end-hex fields (or the sin-
              gle in-hex field) specify the Unicode  range.   The
              out-start-hex  field  (or the out-hex field) speci-
              fies the start of the output encoding  range.   The
              length  of  the  out-start-hex  (or out-hex) string
              determines the  length  of  the  output  characters
              (e.g.,  UTF-8  uses  different  numbers of bytes to
              represent characters in different ranges).  Entries
              must  be  given  in increasing Unicode order.  Only
              one file is allowed per encoding; the  last  speci-
              fied  file  is  used.   The Latin1, ASCII7, Symbol,
              ZapfDingbats, UTF-8, and UCS-2 encodings are prede-
              fined.

       cMapDir registry-ordering dir
              Specifies  a  search  directory, dir, for CMaps for
              the registry-ordering character collection.   There
              can  be  multiple directories for a particular col-
              lection.  There are no default CMap directories.

       toUnicodeDir dir
              Specifies a search directory,  dir,  for  ToUnicode
              CMaps.   There  can  be multiple ToUnicode directo-
              ries.  There are no default ToUnicode  directories.

DISPLAY FONTS
       displayFontT1 PDF-font-name T1-file
              Maps  a  PDF  font, PDF-font-name, to a Type 1 font
              for display.  The Type 1 font file, T1-file, should
              be a standard .pfa or .pfb file.

       displayFontTT PDF-font-name TT-file
              Maps  a PDF font, PDF-font-name, to a TrueType font
              for display.   The  TrueType  font  file,  TT-file,
              should be a standard .ttf file.

       displayNamedCIDFontT1 PDF-font-name T1-file
              Maps    a   specific   PDF   CID   (16-bit)   font,
              PDF-font-name, to a  CID  font  (16-bit  PostScript
              font),  for display.  There are no default CID font
              mappings.

       displayCIDFontT1 registry-ordering T1-file
              Maps the registry-ordering character collection  to
              a  CID  font (16-bit PostScript font), for display.
              This mapping is used if the font name doesn't match
              any of the fonts declared with displayNamedCIDFont*
              commands.  There are no default CID font  mappings.

       displayNamedCIDFontTT PDF-font-name TT-file
              Maps    a   specific   PDF   CID   (16-bit)   font,
              PDF-font-name, to a  (16-bit)  TrueType  font,  for
              display.  There are no default CID font mappings.

       displayCIDFontTT registry-ordering TT-file
              Maps  the registry-ordering character collection to
              a (16-bit) TrueType font, for display.   This  map-
              ping  is used if the font name doesn't match any of
              the fonts declared with  displayNamedCIDFont*  com-
              mands.  There are no default CID font mappings.

       fontDir dir
              Specifies  a  search  directory  for  external font
              files.  There can be multiple fontDir  directories.
              If  a  PDF  file  uses a font but doesn't embed it,
              these directories will be searched for  a  matching
              font  file.  These fonts are used by both xpdf (for
              display) and pdftops (for embedding in  the  gener-
              ated  PostScript).  Type 1 fonts must have a suffix
              of ".pfa", ".pfb", ".ps",  or  no  suffix  at  all.
              TrueType  fonts  must  have a ".ttf" suffix.  Other
              files in these directories will be ignored.   There
              are no default fontDir directories.

POSTSCRIPT CONTROL
       psPaperSize width(pts) height(pts)
              Sets  the  paper  size  for PostScript output.  The
              width and height parameters give the paper size  in
              PostScript points (1 point = 1/72 inch).

       psPaperSize letter | legal | A4 | A3 | match
              Sets  the  paper  size  for  PostScript output to a
              standard size.  The default paper size is set  when
              xpdf  and  pdftops are built, typically to "letter"
              or "A4".  This can also be set  to  "match",  which
              will set the paper size to match the size specified
              in the PDF file.

       psImageableArea llx lly urx ury
              Sets the imageable area for PostScript output.  The
              four integers are the coordinates of the lower-left
              and upper-right corners of  the  imageable  region,
              specified  in  points  (with  the  origin being the
              lower-left corner of the paper).  This defaults  to
              the  full  paper  size; the psPaperSize option will
              reset the imageable area coordinates.

       psCrop yes | no
              If set to "yes", PostScript output  is  cropped  to
              the CropBox specified in the PDF file; otherwise no
              cropping is done.  This defaults to "yes".

       psExpandSmaller yes | no
              If  set  to  "yes",  PDF  pages  smaller  than  the
              PostScript  imageable area are expanded to fill the
              imageable area.  Otherwise, no scalling is done  on
              smaller pages.  This defaults to "no".

       psShrinkLarger yes | no
              If set to yes, PDF pages larger than the PostScript
              imageable area are  shrunk  to  fit  the  imageable
              area.   Otherwise,  no  scaling  is  done on larger
              pages.  This defaults to "yes".

       psCenter yes | no
              If  set  to  yes,  PDF  pages  smaller   than   the
              PostScript  imageable  area (after any scaling) are
              centered in the imageable  area.   Otherwise,  they
              are  aligned at the lower-left corner of the image-
              able area.  This defaults to "yes".

       psDuplex yes | no
              If set to "yes", the generated PostScript will  set
              the  "Duplex" pagedevice entry.  This tells duplex-
              capable  printers  to   enable   duplexing.    This
              defaults to "no".

       psLevel level1 | level1sep | level2 | level2sep | level3 |
       level3Sep
              Sets   the  PostScript  level  to  generate.   This
              defaults to "level2".

       psFont PDF-font-name PS-font-name
              When the PDF-font-name font is used in a PDF  file,
              it  will  be  translated  to  the  PostScript  font
              PS-font-name, which is assumed to  be  resident  in
              the    printer.    Typically,   PDF-font-name   and
              PS-font-name are the same.  By  default,  only  the
              Base-14 fonts are assumed to be resident.

       psNamedFont16 PDF-font-name wMode PS-font-name encoding
              When the 16-bit font PDF-font-name is used in a PDF
              file with the wMode writing mode and is not  embed-
              ded,  the  PS-font-name font is substituted for it.
              The writing mode must be either 'H' for  horizontal
              or  'V'  for  vertical.   The  PS-font-name font is
              assumed to be resident in the printer  and  to  use
              the   specified  encoding  (which  must  have  been
              defined with the unicodeMap command).

       psFont16 registry-ordering wMode PS-font-name encoding
              When a  16-bit  font  using  the  registry-ordering
              character  collection and wMode writing mode is not
              embedded and  does  not  match  any  of  the  fonts
              declared    in    psNamedFont16    commands,    the
              PS-font-name font is substituted for it.  The writ-
              ing  mode  must be either 'H' for horizontal or 'V'
              for vertical.  The PS-font-name font is assumed  to
              be resident in the printer and to use the specified
              writing mode and encoding  (which  must  have  been
              defined with the unicodeMap command).

       psEmbedType1Fonts yes | no
              If  set to "no", prevents embedding of Type 1 fonts
              in generated PostScript.  This defaults to "yes".

       psEmbedTrueTypeFonts yes | no
              If set to  "no",  prevents  embedding  of  TrueType
              fonts  in  generated  PostScript.  This defaults to
              "yes".

       psEmbedCIDTrueTypeFonts yes | no
              If set to "no", prevents embedding of CID  TrueType
              fonts   in   generated  PostScript.   For  Level  3
              PostScript, this generates a CID  font,  for  lower
              levels it generates a non-CID composite font.

       psEmbedCIDPostScriptFonts yes | no
              If   set   to   "no",  prevents  embedding  of  CID
              PostScript  fonts  in  generated  PostScript.   For
              Level  3 PostScript, this generates a CID font, for
              lower levels it generates a non-CID composite font.

       psOPI yes | no
              If  set to "yes", generates PostScript OPI comments
              for all images and forms which  have  OPI  informa-
              tion.   This  option  is only available if the Xpdf
              tools  were  compiled  with  OPI   support.    This
              defaults to "no".

       psASCIIHex yes | no
              If  set to "yes", the ASCIIHexEncode filter will be
              used instead  of  ASCII85Encode  for  binary  data.
              This defaults to "no".

       psFile file-or-command
              Sets  the  default PostScript file or print command
              for xpdf.  Commands start  with  a  '|'  character;
              anything  else is a file.  If the file name or com-
              mand contains  spaces  it  must  be  quoted.   This
              defaults  to  unset, which tells xpdf to generate a
              name  of  the  form  <file>.ps  for  a   PDF   file
              <file>.pdf.

       fontDir dir
              See  the  description  above,  in the DISPLAY FONTS
              section.

TEXT CONTROL
       textEncoding encoding-name
              Sets the encoding to use for  text  output.   (This
              can  be  overridden  with  the "-enc" switch on the
              command line.)  The encoding-name must  be  defined
              with  the  unicodeMap  command  (see  above).  This
              defaults to "Latin1".

       textEOL unix | dos | mac
              Sets the end-of-line convention  to  use  for  text
              output.  The options are:

                  unix = LF
                  dos  = CR+LF
                  mac  = CR

              (This  can  be overridden with the "-eol" switch on
              the command line.)  The default value is  based  on
              the OS where xpdf and pdftotext were built.

       textPageBreaks yes | no
              If  set  to "yes", text extraction will insert page
              breaks (form feed characters) between pages.   This
              defaults to "yes".

       textKeepTinyChars yes | no
              If  set  to  "yes",  text  extraction will keep all
              characters.  If set to "no", text  extraction  will
              discard  tiny  (smaller  than  3  point) characters
              after the first 50000 per page, avoiding  extremely
              slow run times for PDF files that use special fonts
              to do shading or cross-hatching.  This defaults  to
              "no".

MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS
       initialZoom percentage | page | width
              Sets the initial zoom factor.  A number specifies a
              zoom percentage, where 100 means 72 dpi.   You  may
              also  specify 'page', to fit the page to the window
              size, or 'width', to fit the page width to the win-
              dow width.

       enableT1lib yes | no
              Enables  or  disables  use  of t1lib (a Type 1 font
              rasterizer).  This is only  relevant  if  the  Xpdf
              tools    were    built    with    t1lib    support.
              ("enableT1lib"  replaces  the  old   "t1libControl"
              option.)  This option defaults to "yes".

       enableFreeType yes | no
              Enables  or  disables use of FreeType (a TrueType /
              Type 1 font rasterizer).  This is only relevant  if
              the  Xpdf  tools  were built with FreeType support.
              ("enableFreeType" replaces  the  old  "freetypeCon-
              trol" option.)  This option defaults to "yes".

       antialias yes | no
              Enables  or  disables font anti-aliasing in the PDF
              rasterizer.  This option affects all font rasteriz-
              ers.   ("antialias" replaces the anti-aliasing con-
              trol  provided  by  the  old   "t1libControl"   and
              "freetypeControl" options.)  This default to "yes".

       urlCommand command
              Sets the command executed when you click on  a  URL
              link.   The  string  "%s" will be replaced with the
              URL.  (See the example below.)  This has no default
              value.

       movieCommand command
              Sets the command executed when you click on a movie
              annotation.  The string "%s" will be replaced  with
              the movie file name.  This has no default value.

       mapNumericCharNames yes | no
              If set to "yes", the Xpdf tools will attempt to map
              various numeric character names sometimes  used  in
              font  subsets.   In some cases this leads to usable
              text, and in other cases it leads to  gibberish  --
              there is no way for Xpdf to tell.  This defaults to
              "yes".

       printCommands yes | no
              If set to "yes", drawing commands  are  printed  as
              they're  executed  (useful  for  debugging).   This
              defaults to "no".

       errQuiet yes | no
              If set to "yes",  this  suppresses  all  error  and
              warning  messages from all of the Xpdf tools.  This
              defaults to "no".

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc
              This is the default location  for  the  system-wide
              configuration file.  Depending on build options, it
              may be placed elsewhere.

       $HOME/.xpdfrc
              This is  the  user's  configuration  file.   If  it
              exists, it will be read in place of the system-wide
              file.
